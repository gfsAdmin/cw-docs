# Overview

With a reseller account, you will get access to your own white-labelled and customized online admin interface hosted under your own domain. Any customer accounts created through this admin interface will be tagged under your main reseller account. These accounts are not tied into the AirWaiter billing system at all and they will not receive any marketing e-mail from us. While you manage the billing of your customers, we will only bill you.
